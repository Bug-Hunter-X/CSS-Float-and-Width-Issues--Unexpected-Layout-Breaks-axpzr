# CSS Float and Width Issues: Unexpected Layout Breaks

This repository demonstrates a common issue with CSS floats and width percentages, leading to inconsistent layout behavior across different browsers. The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS, while `bugSolution.css` provides a solution using modern CSS techniques to avoid these problems.

**Problem:**
The use of `float: left;` alongside `width: 50%;` can create unpredictable layout when the content does not perfectly fill the allotted space.  This often results in elements not behaving as expected, especially when dealing with varying content lengths.

**Solution:**
The solution uses Flexbox or Grid, offering more robust and predictable layout control, eliminating the issues associated with floats.
