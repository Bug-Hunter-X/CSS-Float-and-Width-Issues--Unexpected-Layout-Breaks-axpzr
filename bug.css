The following CSS code snippet results in unexpected behavior in certain browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

This might cause unexpected layout issues due to the usage of `float`.  The `width: 50%;`  coupled with `float: left;` can create unexpected layout breaks when the content within the divs doesn't perfectly fill the 50% width, leading to content wrapping or collapsing in unexpected ways.
