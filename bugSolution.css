The issue can be resolved using Flexbox or Grid.  Here's an example using Flexbox:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Include padding and border in the 50% width */
}
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap; /* Allows wrapping onto multiple lines if needed */
}
```

This approach provides a more predictable and consistent layout across different browsers and devices.  The `box-sizing: border-box;` rule ensures that padding and borders are included within the element's width calculation.
